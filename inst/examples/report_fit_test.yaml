# Notes:
#
# This controls default placeholders used in the figure and table labels,
# captions, etc  below. The commands and other strings just need a
# placeholder surrounded by === and that will be substituted for the
# placeholder value. The placeholder value can be a string or R Code. The
# underlying functions will attempt to evaluate them. If they evaluate
# successfully, they will have the return value of that evaluation. Otherwise
# the string will be kept as is. To force a string to be a string you need to
# double quote it. So if you specify "'ls()'" you will just see that string.
# If you specify ls() you will see the contents of the enviornment where the
# string is evaluated

# Both figures and tables are generated based on user defined commands. These
# will be depdendnt on input data (e.g., nlmixr fit object), default
# dimensions (figure width and height), the type of report being generated
# (onbrand report object), etc. The following objects will be created
# in the environment where the user code is executed and can be used by the
# user defined code. Some variables are content type specific and are only
# present in the environtment for that content type. For example the resoluion
# option only applies to figures and is not defined in the table generation
# environment:
#
#  fid          - current figure ID
#  fit          - nlmixr fit object
#  height       - figure height (figure enviornment only)
#  length_units - units for length and width below (figure enviornment only)
#  obnd         - onbrand object of the report document
#  output_dir   - directory where figures are stored
#  resolution   - resolution of the figure (figure environment only)
#  rptdetails   - result of reading in the report yaml file
#  rpttype      - either "Word" or "PowerPoint"
#  width        - figure width  (figure environment only)
#  xpdb         - xpose object created from xpose_data_nlmixr(fit) (figure
#                 environment only)
#
# The output must be stored in p_res and it can be either of the following:
#  - character variable containing the path to the figure file (you can have
#    multiple figures that will be treated as paginated).
#  - ggplot object (this can be a single figure or a paginated figure)
