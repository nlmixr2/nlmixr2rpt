Description: This allows you to generate reporting workflows around `nlmixr2` analyses with outputs in Word and PowerPoint. You can specify figures, tables and report structure in a user-definable yaml file. Also you can use the internal functions to access the figures and tables to allow their including in other outputs (e.g. RMarkdown).
